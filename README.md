## Description
Sample of an online ECommerce site created with React. It is a fake clothing shop, but it can be easily customized for different customers and businesses.

## About
The API has been created with AirTable, which allows the customer to add new products in a quick way, as well as to update their different features (colours, size...). AirTable is also convenient to control the prices, stocks, etc. Stripe has been included as the platform for payments, because of its fast implementation as well as the simple usage on the client-side.

## Design
The mockup design has been done with Figma. It follows the same pattern as most of the ECommerce sites, so that the user gets familiar with it very quickly. 

## Tools
React, Figma, Airtable, Auth0 Stripe.
Javascript, CSS.
